# Welcome to angular.love Advent Calendar 2024!

December is here, and we’re excited to bring you something special to close the year with gratitude and celebration! 🎉

angular.love Advent Calendar is a daily countdown to the holidays, where we spotlight the incredible work, passion, and creativity of our Angular community. Each day, we’ll open a new page filled with memories, throwbacks, and highlights from the past year. This is our way of saying thank you to everyone who has contributed to the vibrant Angular ecosystem—bloggers, speakers, meetup organizers, open-source contributors, and our amazing friends and collaborators. It’s also a chance to rediscover hidden gems, celebrate milestones, and revisit the blogs, recordings, and projects that have shaped our journey.

## What to Expect

- **Daily Highlights** - A featured blog post, video, or resource from our archives, complete with a summary and reflections from its authors.
- **Community Voices** - Personal notes and comments from the creators themselves, sharing their inspiration, challenges, or behind-the-scenes moments.
- **Inspiration & Ideas** - Learn, reflect, and connect as we revisit the best of Angular content this year and beyond.

## Why angular.love Advent? ❤️

This event isn’t just about looking back—it’s about strengthening the connections in our Angular community and celebrating the collective knowledge we’ve built together. Whether you’re a seasoned Angular pro or new to the ecosystem, this calendar is for you.

Each day, we’ll bring you something meaningful to enjoy—a small gift of learning, sharing, and remembering.
